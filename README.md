# FHIR Processor V2

This repository contains the skeleton for the **FHIR Processor V2** project.

## Structure

- `backend/`  – .NET 8 Web API (Firely + Rule Engine + Validation Pipeline)
- `frontend/` – React + TypeScript + Vite Playground & Rule Editor
- `docs/`     – Architecture and design documents (see your existing MD files)
- `specs/`    – Requirements, IG notes, schemas
- `examples/` – Sample FHIR bundles, rules, codes

Use this as a starting point and plug in the implementation based on the `/docs` specs you already generated.
